Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).


### 2015

I started out with Bash, but added some Perl to the mix when Bash just took too long.

I try to stick to pure Bash without too much reliance on command line tools (reason: definitely not performance), but whenever pure Bash really is too slow or cumbersome (day 10, second part for example), I'll gladly take the multiple orders of improved performance.
