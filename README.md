Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/).


### 2015

I started out with Bash, but added some Perl to the mix when Bash just took too long.

I tried sticking to pure Bash without too much reliance on command line tools (reason: definitely not performance), but whenever pure Bash really was too slow or cumbersome (day 10, second part for example), I gladly took the multiple orders of improved performance.

### 2016

Everything in awk, with the odd solution in Perl or Bash and utilities such as grep or `sort`.

For MD5 hashing, I used [this awk extension](http://git.codu.in/sup/gawk-extensions) written in C.
