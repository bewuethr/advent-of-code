# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

See the [aoc-stats](https://github.com/bewuethr/aoc-stats) repo for a static
site generator with extended statistics.

## 2015

I started out with Bash, but added some Perl to the mix when Bash just took too
long.

I tried sticking to pure Bash without too much reliance on command line tools
(reason: definitely not performance), but whenever pure Bash really was too
slow or cumbersome (day 10, second part for example), I gladly took the
multiple orders of improved performance.

## 2016

Everything in awk, with the odd solution in Perl or Bash and utilities such as
grep or `sort`.

For MD5 hashing, I used an extension from
[here](https://github.com/su8/gawk-extensions), written in C.

## 2017

Perl for speed (everything), Go to learn (first 13 days).

Uploads are "polished", but the oldest commit per file is the honest version
used to solve the puzzle.

## 2018

Perl. First commits per day are the honest truth, afterwards I cleaned up.

## 2019

I thought "probably Go", but ended up with Perl again for day 1. Then gave up,
then came back and did everything in Go[^1].

## 2020

Mostly awk, and a tiny bit sed.

## 2021

Node.js[^1], with the first three days also in awk.


## 2022

Awk so far? Some Bash? Perl?[^1]

[^1]: In progress
